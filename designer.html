    <h1>Product Designer</h1>
    <div class="careers-body"><h6>
      Zenysis builds software for developing nations to better leverage their data for good. Countries are using our platform to deliver lifesaving resources to millions in need, track the spread of infectious diseases, and manage the distribution of vaccines to dramatically decrease death from preventable disease.
      <p></p>
      As our first product designer, you’ll have the opportunity to take broad ownership over new features and reimagine core parts of our existing product. We’re looking for someone who can not only dream up great ideas, but can also implement them alongside our engineers - meaning CSS, HTML, and rapid prototyping abilities are important.
      <p></p>
      You’ll connect with users on the ground to better understand their needs and communicate them to our engineers and product managers. We’ll also be relying on you to serve as a liaison between teams and integrate their insights into a cohesive vision. As we expand, you will be an integral part of growing and leading our Product Design team.
      <p></p>
      We do not use “passion” as code for “80 hour work week”. Because we’re building a company for long-term impact, we’ve chosen to be proactive about ensuring a healthy work/life balance and invest heavily in mentorship, learning, and personal development. People who work at Zenysis have lives outside the office. As a global company, diversity is important to us.
      <p></p>
      We’re profitable, well funded, and run by founders with proven track records of success.
      <p></p>

      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <ul class="careers-bullets">Qualifications:
        <li>Comfort with user-centric design, prototyping, research and iteration</li>

        <li>Basic quantitative fluency</li>
        <li>Expertise with at least one prototyping tool</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      We value the ability to build deep understanding, but you don’t need mastery of any specific tool.
      <p></p>
      We value learning, but you don’t need a Master’s degree, PhD, or degree from a top-ten school.
      <p></p>
      We value impressive track records, but you don’t need years of experience at a brand-name company.
